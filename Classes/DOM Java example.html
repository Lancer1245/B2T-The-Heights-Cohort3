	// parseInt() turns any value into a number

	var word= verb
// charAt() allows me to see what position the letter is in. word.charAt(0)=v. 0 is the 1st place.

// word.length allows you to figure out how many letters are in the word.

//Lets combine word.charAt(word.lenght-1) to find another position

'verb'
 0123

 //3 is my last index. Lenght -1 will give you the last index. The result is b.

 // word.IndexOf('e'). Result is 1. word.IndexOf('E') Result is -1.

 //slice allows you to get a section of a word. 

 //slice has 2 inputs word.slice(1st input where you start, 2nd input is exclusive which stops at the index but doesn't include it.)

 //word.slice(0,3)

 'verb'
  0123

 //result is ver


//word.slice(1)

 'verb'
  0123

//resut is erb


 'verb'
  0123

//word.slice(1)+word.charAt(0). This means that you want to move the first letter to the end. wordslice will give erb and charAt will give the first letter v. + will add it to the end.

// Result "erbv"
